 <section>
   <p>Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” — John 15:13 (NKJV)

As policemen, you’re going to encounter many people who are hurting. This could be over something as minor as a traffic ticket they don’t want to pay or, on a deeper level, from struggles that aren’t always visible. Remember not to judge based on appearances, because God doesn’t judge by outward appearances. Instead, He looks at the heart, and each person you meet has a story that shapes who they are.

Some of the people you might interact with have been labeled due to past mistakes, medical conditions, or societal judgments. They carry burdens, and these labels may come from a diagnosis by a doctor or others who specialize in such matters. However, many of these people turn to Christ after facing severe challenges, using the pain from their past to help heal others. God can work through their experiences, and their strength can inspire those around them.
     
<p> “For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.” — Galatians 1:10 (NKJV)

A bondservant of Jesus Christ doesn’t seek personal gain, because Jesus, through His death on the cross, has already given us the ultimate gift: eternal life in heaven. As you serve others, remember that you are not called to judge, but to love, to show compassion, and to reflect Christ’s grace in all you do.

    <p> <h2> study topic Trust </h2>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths." – Proverbs 3:5-6 (KJV)

As a police officer, you will face challenges in your surroundings—whether it’s giving a speeding ticket to a drunk driver or dealing with high-level drug dealers. Whatever the situation might be, I encourage you to put your trust in someone who will always have your back, and that someone is Jesus.
<p>"Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit." – Jeremiah 17:7-8 (KJV)

By putting your trust in Jesus, you produce love, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, and self-control—these are the fruits of the Spirit. When you think about it, trusting someone requires being at peace with your decision. It may even require patience if you're trusting someone to do something that takes time. For kindness, you can't be angry with the person if you truly trust them. And how can you hurt someone you trust? Self-control is also tied to trust. These are all attributes of trust.

  “And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.”
‭‭2 Samuel‬ ‭6‬:‭12‬-‭23‬ ‭KJV‬‬
David chose to worship God every six steps as he brought the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem. He danced before the Lord with such passion that, after traveling several miles, his clothes tore off. 

In your job, whether as a policeman or in any other profession, you will encounter people who may not know about Jesus or who know of Him but choose to reject Him. Adopting David’s “six-step” approach—worshiping your Creator through your work—not only deepens your relationship with your Father in Heaven but also sets an example for others.

This approach isn’t always easy, and it may not seem immediately rewarding. But consider King David: he walked all those miles, stopping to worship every six steps. The Bible describes him as a man after God’s own heart. If we also want to be people after God’s own heart, his example is one worth following.
  <section> <h3> study topic deep dive all three love compassion, trust, worship </h3> “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭22‬:‭37‬-‭40‬ ‭KJV‬‬ <p> In this passage, Jesus emphasizes that all the commandments and the teachings of the prophets center on love—love for God and love for others. He not only taught this principle but also demonstrated it through His actions. Ultimately, Jesus showed the greatest act of love by sacrificing Himself on the cross. He loved His neighbors in a way no one else could, asking His Father to forgive even those who were persecuting Him. Through His obedience to the will of the Father, He showed His unwavering love for God, YHWH, and for humanity, extending compassionate forgiveness to all who repent. <p>

This teaches us that we, too, are called to love others deeply—not just in words but in actions. Loving others doesn’t mean superficial gestures; it means reflecting God’s love through the way we live. For example, as a policeman, you may need to enforce the law by arresting someone, but even in that role, you can show love by treating them with respect and pointing them toward a better path. Let your actions reveal God’s love through you.

  <h4> study topic God's promises for policeman </h4>
  Matthew 5:9

No matter what the world may say, God has placed you in a field that allows you to be a peacemaker. This means you are in a uniquely blessed position. While anyone can attempt to keep the peace, not everyone can say it is their calling or daily responsibility. <p>

“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”
Luke 10:19 (KJV) <p> 

God’s promises of protection are evident throughout the Bible, and as a law enforcement officer, you will likely draw strength from them often.

    <h7> study topic Still small voice</h7>
    <p>
<p>
 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice."
1 Kings 19:12 (KJV)

In law enforcement, you will face many storms and trials. In the midst of these challenges, it might feel as though the Holy Spirit is shouting at you to act. However, it’s important to pause and listen for the still small voice that will guide and direct you on the right path.

For instance, imagine you're on a long journey in your patrol car and run out of gas. You radio for assistance, and suddenly multiple voices are giving you conflicting directions: "Go to this gas station," or "No, go to that one." Amid the noise, the radio cuts out, and you glance beside you—only to discover a gas station right there, unnoticed until now. You fill your tank, the radio resumes working, and you realize you had everything you needed the entire time.

This illustrates how the Holy Spirit often communicates. Beyond the chaos and noise, the still small voice leads you with clarity and assurance. Learning to recognize and trust it is essential in both your personal and professional life.
